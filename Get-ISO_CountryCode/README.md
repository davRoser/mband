Today I had a need to populate the 2 character country code in Active Directory - many of the codes were out of date or otherwise incorrect and this was causing AD synchronization problems. We want to use the ISO 3166 codes since these will be universally recognized and provide consistency across platforms and applications. In AD country information is stored in 3 attributes: "c" is the 2 character IS0 3166-1 alpha-2 code, "countryCode" is the 3 digit ISO 3166-1 numeric code, and "co" is used for the country name which is also defined in the ISO 3166 standard. In this example we have the country name and need to retrieve the 2 character code - we will use Bing Maps and a REST call to obtain this information. The ability to pull this infomration dynamically vs. having to maintain your own static table represents a tremendously efficient access method. Note you will need to obtain a Bing Maps Key - instructions are here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx. This is a very simple and easy to use yet powerful capability that might inspire you to look further into what other RESTful data sources are available.
